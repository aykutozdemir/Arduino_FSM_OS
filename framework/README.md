# FsmOS Framework

This is the core FsmOS framework directory. It contains the main scheduler and task management system.

## Structure

- `include/` - Header files (public API)
- `src/` - Implementation files

## Integration with External Libraries

External libraries should be placed in the `../libs/` directory. Each library should have its own subdirectory.

## Usage

Include the main header:
```cpp
#include <FsmOS.h>
```
